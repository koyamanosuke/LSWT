# Spin-wave theory
This repository is created to examine elementary excitations from the ground state after determining localized states through the mean-field theory.
The details of the program is based on the spin-wave theory.

# Available physical quantities
quasiparticle dispersions, dynamical structure factors (with quasiparticles damping), susceptibility, thermal Hall conductivity, etc.

# Requirement
* C/C++ compiler (intel, GNU, etc. )
* LAPACK library (intel MKL, ATLAS, etc.)
* cpplapack-2015.05.11
* openmpi-4.0.4
* boost-1.78.0
* Python (If you would like to plot the results such as the dispersions or spectra)
